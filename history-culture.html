Jill Biden spent most of her childhood in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Having always enjoyed English classes in high school, Biden eventually earned two master's degrees and a doctorate in education from the University of Delaware. Throughout her career, Biden has taught at community colleges and later developed related college programs with backing from the White House. Before becoming first lady in 2020, Biden was America's second lady during President Obama’s terms and helped raise awareness about supporting military families, education, and women's issues.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"><strong>Quick Facts</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Jill Tracy Biden<br>BORN: June 3, 1951<br>BIRTHPLACE: Hammonton, New Jersey<br>SPOUSES: Bill Stevenson (1970-1975) and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/joe-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe Biden" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Joe Biden</u></a> (1977-present)<br>CHILDREN: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/beau-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Beau class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Beau</u></a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/hunter-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Hunter class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Hunter</u></a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ashley-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ashley class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Ashley</u><br></a>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Biden was born Jill Tracy Jacobs on June 3, 1951, in Hammonton, New Jersey. However, she spent most of her childhood in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, with her parents and four younger sisters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though she set out to study fashion merchandising at a junior college in Pennsylvania, Biden soon found her studies unsatisfying and left school. Around the same time, she married Bill Stevenson, a boy she had begun dating in the summer of 1969 — the same year she had graduated from high school. The two decided to attend the University of Delaware together, and Biden majored in English. By their junior year, the couple had drifted apart and divorced in 1975. Biden then took a year off from school, knowing she would return and finish.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage, Family, and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the spring of 1975, Biden was set up on a blind date with then-U.S. Senator Joe Biden by his brother. In 1977, the Bidens were married. Biden helped her husband raise his two sons from a previous marriage, and they had a daughter of their own, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/ashley-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ashley class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Ashley</u></a>, in 1981. Within two years, Biden was "itching" for more, according to an article in Vogue magazine, and decided to return to school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While working in a psychiatric hospital — where she taught English to adolescents with emotional disabilities for five years — Biden earned two master's degrees from Villanova University and West Chester University. She taught for three years at Claymont High School and then at Delaware Technical and Community College. Biden also earned her doctorate in education from the University of Delaware in January 2007.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Professor and U.S. Second Lady</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Biden has been a professor of English at Northern Virginia Community College since 2009, the same year her husband was sworn in as vice president of the United States after Barack Obama's 2008 presidential win. In 2010, she hosted the first-ever White House Summit on Community Colleges with President Obama. She also continued to work on related outreach for the administration, as later seen with the 2012 Community College to Career bus tour, and was a co-founder of the Book Buddies program.

In response, Joe Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot to increase funding and accelerate research in the search for new treatments and cures, with Jill Biden playing a prominent role in the program’s outreach efforts. The couple would later create the Biden Cancer Initiative to continue their work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around this time, there was also the question of whether Joe Biden would run for U.S. president.

When asked how she balanced the demands of a career and her role as first lady, she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/life-strategies/exclusive-interview-first-lady-jill-biden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Real Simple" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Real Simple</u></a>, “You can't do anything in a haphazard way.

That's the key to it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Biden played a vital role in the Biden administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, traveling the country to encourage vaccination and supporting efforts to safely reopen schools. She also worked closely on the relaunch of the Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative. She stumped for the president’s efforts to pass legislation making community college tuition free for most students.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Biden has long been involved in her work supporting military families, inspired partly by her stepson Beau’s military service. As Second Lady, she became involved with the nonprofit organization Delaware Boots on the Ground, which helps families during military deployment. Biden and then-First Lady <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/michelle-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michelle Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Michelle Obama</u></a> also launched Joining Forces.
