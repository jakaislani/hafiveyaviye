He happens to be the only child of his parents.</p><p>Midway through the 1980s, his father played in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Toronto Argonauts, and Ottawa Rough Riders. He then joined the Canadian national bobsleigh squad.</p><p>At age five, his mother introduced him to organized hockey, and throughout the winter, his father kept a backyard rink where Hall and his buddies practiced nonstop.</p><p>His family relocated to Kingston, Ontario, in 2005, where he finished high school at Frontenac Secondary School before continuing his education while playing for the Windsor Spitfires at St. Anne’s Catholic High School in Tecumseh, Ontario.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/27104852/image-694.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Taylor Hall career</h2><p>Hall signed his first professional contract soon after the Edmonton Oilers took him first overall in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.</p><p>Hall received a base salary of $900,000 under the terms of the contract, plus an additional $2.85 million in performance bonuses. In Oilers history, this was the second-highest-paying&nbsp;rookie deal.</p><p>Despite the fact that Kevin Lowe was the only Oiler to wear the number 4 in the team’s NHL history and that Lowe’s number 4 had not been retired by the Oilers, Hall was permitted to wear the jersey number 4, which had belonged to the former Oilers player. Lowe was also the team’s president of hockey operations at the time.</p><p>On October 7, 2010, as the Oilers trounced their Battle of Alberta rivals, the Calgary Flames, at Rexall Place, Hall made his NHL debut.</p><p>As a rookie, Hall was picked for the 2011 NHL All-Star Game. A newly established structure for the 2011 All-Star Game particularly selected 12 rookies to compete in the NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition.</p><p>Hall achieved his first Gordie Howe hat-trick of his career on March 3, 2011, in a 4-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. Hall scored a goal against Steve Mason, assisted Jordan Eberle on a goal, and engaged in combat with Derek Dorsett.</p><p><br>Prior to a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on January 17, 2012, Hall was struck by teammate Corey Potter’s skate during warmup, sustaining a serious cut to his face that required 30 stitches to repair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/27104823/image-692-1024x723.png><p>Hall re-signed with the Oilers on August 21, 2012, for a seven-year, $42 million deal with an average annual value of $6 million.</p><p>In a 4-3 loss to the Calgary Flames on January 26, 2013, Hall notched his 100th career point with two assists. The NHL suspended him for two games on February 22, 2013, following a collision with Minnesota Wilds forward Cal Clutterbuck.</p><p>On October 17, 2013, Hall scored two goals in eight seconds, shattering Wayne Gretzky’s previous Oilers franchise record of two goals in nine seconds.</p><p>Hall was exchanged for Adam Larsson by the New Jersey Devils on June 29, 2016. Since the Devils had retired the number 4 in Scott Stevens’ honor, Hall opted to wear the number 9 while playing for the squad.</p><p>In the 2017–18 NHL season, Hall was once more selected to play in the All-Star Game. Brian Boyle, a teammate, took his place due to a hand injury.</p><p>Hall’s 16-game point streak on February 15, 2018, in a victory over the Carolina Hurricanes, established a Devils franchise record.</p><p>Prior to the Devils’ 2018–19 season, Hall was chosen an alternative captain. He sustained an injury during practice on December 13, 2018, which resulted in him missing two games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/27104844/image-693-1024x768.png><p>Hall and Blake Speers were exchanged for Nick Merkley, Kevin Bahl, Nate Schnarr, a conditional first-round pick in 2020, and a conditional third-round pick in 2021 by the Devils on December 16, 2019,&nbsp;in a deal with the Arizona Coyotes.</p><p>Taylor Hall will become an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career when the Coyotes general manager Bill Armstrong made the announcement on October 7, 2020, that they would not be re-signing Hall.</p><p>Hall signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Buffalo Sabres on October 11, 2020. Hall decided to forego free agency on July 23, 2021 by signing a four-year, $24 million contract extension with the Bruins.</p><p>Hall and Nick Foligno were transferred by the Boston Bruins to the Chicago Blackhawks on June 26, 2023 in exchange for Ian Mitchell and Alec Regula because of salary cap ramifications.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Taylor Hall have any children?</h2><p>As of the time of filing this report, Taylor Hall and his wife, Rachel Rush have no children.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jq2YsqSfp3qprculZJygmaGxs7HNaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./julia-louis-dreyfuss-husband-everything-to-know-about-the-actresss-personal-life.html>&#171;&nbsp;Everything to Know About the Actress's Personal Life</a>
