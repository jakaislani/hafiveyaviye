He wanted to be a hero and helped the Titans save Gotham City from Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow (Vincent Kartheiser) and his reign of terror. For his efforts, Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Brenton Thwaites) permitted Tim Drake to join the team and train as the new Robin, and he traveled with them on their trip to Metropolis.</p><h2 id=h-tim-drake-and-bernard-s-story data-injectable=false>Tim Drake and Bernard‚Äôs story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Robin-Bernard-Titans.jpg><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>In Titans season four, episode one, ‚ÄúLex Luthor,‚Äù the Titans visit S.T.A.R.

He‚Äôs been helping them figure out what‚Äôs happening with Mother Mayhem (Franka Potente) and her interest in Sebastian Sanger/Brother Blood (Joseph Morgan), and he‚Äôs been spending quality time helping Tim Drake train to become the new Robin.
