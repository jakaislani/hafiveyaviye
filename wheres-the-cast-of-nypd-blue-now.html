One wants the actors to succeed even after the show ends or their tenure on the series does. One such show is <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NYPD Blue</a></strong> which was created by Steven Bochco and David Milch. Milch’s inspiration for the series was his friendship with Bill Clark, a former NYC Cop, who eventually consulted on the show as a producer.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>It premiered on ABC on Sept. 21, 1993, and ran until March 1, 2005, holding the title of the longest-running drama for the network until Grey’s Anatomy took it in 2016. Over the course of the series, audiences were introduced to many talented actors who went on to do great things. Here’s a look at ten of them.</p><h2 id=h-dennis-franz data-injectable=false>Dennis Franz</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Dennis Franz played Detective Andy Sipowicz of the 15th Precinct of the NYPD for all 12 seasons of the show appearing in 261 episodes. Post Blue he retired from acting and is enjoying the good life which includes plenty of time outdoors and with his family.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>“I just wanted to live an enjoyable, irresponsible, spend-time-with-my-family kind of life. I haven’t regretted one minute of it. I’m pretty good at doing nothing,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a> in 2015.

Unfortunately, his story after the series is not as happy as his fictional father’s. In February of 2023, he was found dead at the age of 27. The investigation into his death is still ongoing but authorities are calling it a “suspected fentanyl poisoning.”</p><p>Franz found Major’s death hard to process. “I was so shocked and saddened to hear of Austin’s passing. Austin was always such a joy to have on the set, he brought smiles and happiness to everyone. Although we haven’t stayed in touch since the show ended in 2005, I will always remember him fondly. My love and condolences to his family,” he wrote in a statement to<a href=#> Fox News Digital.</a></p><h2 id=h-david-caruso data-injectable=false>David Caruso</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=895 data-injectable=true>Actor David Caruso did not have a long tenure on Blue. He played Detective John Kelly for only two seasons and was not easy to get along with on set. “Caruso felt he was too good for television…He wanted to be a movie star. And his plan was to alienate the writers, producers, and his fellow castmates in hopes that we would dump him from the show,”<a href=#> stated creator Steven Bochco</a>. David got his wish. John Kelly was said to be working as a private security advisor overseas and that was that. Post Blue Caruso would go on to tackle another procedural drama, the CBS series CSI: Miami.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-gordon-clapp data-injectable=false>Gordon Clapp</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Gordon Clapp played Detective Greg Medavoy for all 12 seasons of the show and even won an Emmy award for it.
