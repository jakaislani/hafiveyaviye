beliefs working on the family farm.&nbsp; While in her late twenties, she moved to Virginia where she met the love of her life,&nbsp;Jacob Lafayette&nbsp;Joyner&nbsp;(deceased) and was joined together in holy matrimony.&nbsp; Together, they enjoyed a fruitful life of happiness worshipping and praising God with their twelve children. &nbsp;During this time, they brought their first home on Ann Street in Portsmouth, VA, there, they enjoyed their life together.</p><p>God called&nbsp;Naomi’s husband Jacob home to rest early&nbsp;in their marriage with their youngest child only being three months old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi, now widowed, went on to raise her twelve children as a single parent.&nbsp; Prior to the death of her husband Jacob,&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;was a housewife.&nbsp; After losing

Naomi&nbsp;also made the best sweet potato pies, biscuits, and fried chicken.&nbsp; During the holidays,&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would bake up to 20 pies to give whole pies away to family and friends.&nbsp;Often times, Naomi&nbsp;would cook&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;cakes, donate them to her church. &nbsp;&nbsp;She believed in family gathering on Sundays, holidays and special events. When her family came together, and it was often, her home was full, loud, and had standing room only.&nbsp; She would ensure all who wanted to be part of the special event were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would spend hours on the phone calling everyone to get the word out to come over.&nbsp; It was magical.&nbsp; Just the way she liked it.&nbsp; Her sisters and brothers from South Carolina, North Carolina and New York, often times would come on holidays and other special occasions.&nbsp; She would many times travel to South Carolina to be part of the annual family reunion.&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would also spend hours on the phone with her best friend she met while working at Maryview Hospital.&nbsp; They were friends for more than 40 years.&nbsp; We called her Ms. Emma.</p><p>Naomi&nbsp;leaves behind one brother, Henry Hamilton (Edna), and three sisters, Frances Smith (Chal), Amy Washington (Joe/deceased), and Louise McDaniel (Willie).&nbsp; She has two brothers and one sister that&nbsp;pre-deceased&nbsp;her in death. &nbsp;Robert C&nbsp;Hamilton (Ya/deceased), June&nbsp;Hamilton (deceased)/Ruth Mae and her loving oldest sister, Wilena&nbsp;Bethea (Frank) both deceased.</p><p>Naomi’s brothers and sisters though marriage, Alfred Joyner (Alice) both deceased, James Joyner (Sanay-Bell) both deceased, Dillard Joyner (deceased), Quient Joyner (Earlene/deceased), Theresa Gay (Henry) both deceased, Laura Joyner (Clinton) both deceased, Gladys Robinson (Lawrence) both deceased, and Julia Harris (Johnnie/deceased).</p><p>Naomi&nbsp;was a mother of twelve children,&nbsp;Mary(Sandy), Louella (deceased)/Ray, Debbie,&nbsp;James(Jackie/deceased), Lonnie,&nbsp;Angela (Andrew), Denise (Earl), Lavasier (Ann), Dorothy (Clarence), Thressia,&nbsp;Kim&nbsp;and Calvin (Taryn).&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandchildren, Lisa White, Patricia White, Joseph White, David White,&nbsp;RayLynn&nbsp;Best, Kimberly Best, Dominic Wright,&nbsp; Marcus Bell, Loletta Bowden, Valencia Matthew,&nbsp; Lydia&nbsp;Joyner, Latrice&nbsp;Joyner, Angie Alston, Pedro&nbsp;Joyner, Tomika Alston, Bernie Alston, &nbsp;Marquis (Isaiah) Roberts, Mya Roberts, Jacob&nbsp;Joyner, Kendrick Robinson, Latosha Robinson, Jaccara Sandanski, Tiffany&nbsp;Joyner, (Lavasier daughter), Jamar Joyner, Anthony Joyner, Jackie Joyner, James&nbsp;Joyner, Tiffany&nbsp;Joyner, Terrell&nbsp;Joyner, Christopher&nbsp;Joyner,&nbsp; Toya&nbsp;Joyner, Amy&nbsp;Joyner, Giovani Conner and Cosima&nbsp;Joyner; and a host of great, great-great&nbsp;grands, nieces, nephews and friends.</p><p>During her life she was impactful and a blessing as she served so many.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always willing to share a helping hand, a prayer, message of hope, a message of faith and message of God’s unconditional love.</p><p>Naomi&nbsp;lived her life as documented in the gospel of Mark 10:45:</p><p>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many&nbsp;(Mark 10:45).&nbsp;&nbsp;These words were spoken by the Son of God on a day when his disciples needed a proper perspective on servanthood (Mark 10:36) and when a blind man cried out for mercy (Mark 10:51).&nbsp;&nbsp;The son of God, surrounded by endless requests and wearied by miles of walking looked need squarely in the face and asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”&nbsp; (Mark 10:51).&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the burden another carried and offered to help with the load.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the spirit of&nbsp;Naomi!</p><p>Now this beautiful servant, can rest!&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have finished the course&nbsp;and kept the faith!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the gates of heaven where there is a place Jesus has prepared for you!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNopZ%2Bptaa%2BjKeYqKWZYrWiucilq6imXZ%2B8urrEq2Y%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./timothy-a-chey.html>&#171;&nbsp;Timothy A.
