Often, I post salad recipes with a dressing included – a kale salad with carrot ginger dressing, a watermelon salad tossed with lime juice. But a few weeks ago, as I was whisking together this lemon vinaigrette, I realized that tying a dressing to a specific salad recipe can sometimes sell it short. This lemon vinaigrette is one of my favorite salad dressings.

I have about 53 radish recipes on the site, and of those, 52(!) use raw radishes. Obviously, raw radishes have a lot going for them. Peppery, crunchy, and vibrant pink, they’re perfect for amping up salads, sandwiches, and bowls. But what about cooking radishes? These numbers don’t show it, but I often roast radishes at home. Unlike their raw counterparts, roasted radishes taste lightly sweet and mellow, with just a hint of their original spice. They have an irresistible crisp-tender bite, and they’re delicious on their own…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Don’t toss those radish greens! I don’t know who got the idea that radish and turnip greens, carrot tops, kale stems, broccoli stalks, and other common veggie scraps should be discarded, but I’m here to tell you that it’s not true. At this time of year, I’m equally happy feasting on lush radish tops as I am spinach or Swiss chard. They’re not as popular, but they have a lovely peppery flavor, and they’re easy to cook. Best of all, they come with radishes attached! What’s not to love? Below, you’ll find my best tips for cooking radish tops, as…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Have you ever tried za’atar? The word actually refers to two things: an herb related to thyme and oregano and a Middle Eastern spice blend. Here, we’ll be focusing on the spice. It’s herby, nutty, tangy, and salty, and it’s a seasoning that you absolutely want to be cooking with. Though you can find za’atar seasoning at Middle Eastern grocery stores and spice shops, it’s still not widely available in the US. If you can get your hands on a good store bought blend, I encourage you to try it, but you should also make your own. That way, you’ll…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>The hardest part of making labneh cheese is waiting. Everything else is simple. Mix together 2 ingredients – Greek yogurt and salt – wrap them in a cheesecloth, and hang it over a bowl to strain. Then, things get tough: you’ll have to wait 24 hours to open the cheesecloth and enjoy the thick, creamy yogurt cheese inside. But if you try this labneh recipe, I think you’ll agree that the wait is totally worth it. If you’re not familiar with labneh, it’s a soft cheese made by straining yogurt to remove the whey. It has a thick, spreadable texture…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This homemade pita bread recipe comes from my friend Molly Yeh. It’s been on my list to try for years, but for one reason or another, I never made it until this spring. When I finally did, what Jack and I thought would be a fun, one-time cooking project turned into a full-on pita bread obsession. We started putting extra yogurt on the grocery list just so we could make it! If you’re thinking, “Wait. Yogurt? In pita bread?”, you’re not crazy. It’s not a typical pita bread recipe ingredient. But in my opinion, it’s what makes this pita bread…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Three months ago, if someone had told me that Jack and I would start making homemade hamburger buns every week, I would have laughed. To me, hamburger buns seemed like something that only professional bakers could make. But since Jack’s been baking up a storm lately, the idea of homemade hamburger buns started to seem less and less crazy. If we could make bagels and bread, why not hamburger buns too? After testing and re-testing this recipe, I’m happy to report that homemade hamburger buns are surprisingly easy to make! They require under 30 minutes of hands-on work, and they’re…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Have you ever made a bread or cake recipe that promised to be moist and tender but turned out to be dry and dense? You’re not alone. This is a common problem in baking, and often, the solution is trying a new method for how to measure flour. First, if you don’t already have a kitchen scale, get one, because weighing your flour will give you the most accurate measurement every time. When you weigh the flour for a recipe, you know exactly how much you’re using. By contrast, when you measure by volume, the actual amount of flour you…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>If you’re looking for an easy side to pair with your veggie burgers this weekend, these air fryer French fries are just the thing for you! I know, I know. When it comes to grilling sides, I’m usually all about salads or corn on the cob, but sometimes, I get a craving for a salty, crunchy snack that even the best summer salad can’t satisfy. That’s where these air fryer French fries come in. In a lot of ways, they’re just like regular fries.

They had a chewy texture, a sweet, oat-y flavor, and pockets of mini chocolate chips. These days, I don’t keep packaged snacks around the house, but I always have old fashioned oats, nuts, and seeds in my pantry. I might not have had the exact granola bars I was craving on hand, but I could make homemade granola bars that’d be even better! Fast forward to now, and I’ve made this granola bar recipe more times than I can count.

Jack and I have been all about cooking projects lately, churning out homemade bagels, pasta, tortillas, and more. We’ve loved all of them, but this homemade peanut butter recipe reminded us that cooking projects don’t have to be ambitious to be fun. This peanut butter recipe calls for just 1 or 2 ingredients, and it comes together in under 10 minutes. Still, making it is a blast!
