Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>There isn’t much information available on how much money she has following the divorce. She was a successful corporate accountant as well as a traditional teacher.

However, that was little compared to what she earned following her divorce from Azharuddin.</p><p>Naureen maintained the money she received and utilized it to pay for her son’s education. Her <strong>net worth</strong> is currently around $700,000 every year. Despite the fact that she has not disclosed her current job, media searches show that she is employed.</p><h2><span id=Naureen_Azharuddin-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings>Naureen Azharuddin- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings</span></h2><p>She was born in 1971 in Hyderabad, India.

First, she used to give several seminars in various colleges. Second, she worked as a traditional teacher at a number of schools.</p><h2><span id=Naureen_Azharuddin-_Relationship_Married_Life><strong>Naureen Azharuddin- Relationship, Married Life</strong></span></h2><p>Her name came to light after Mohammad Azharuddin confessed she was his first wife.

She is Mohammad Azharuddin’s divorced wife, and they have one child, Mohammad Asaduddin. In addition, a biopic of Mohammad has been made, in which Naureen is played by Bollywood actress Prachi Desai.</p><h3><span id=Mohammad_Azharuddin_remarried>Mohammad Azharuddin remarried</span></h3><p>On the one hand, Mohammad married Sangeeta Bijlani. He married the actress in 1996, but they divorced in 2010. Many people were triggered by the news of his upcoming divorce.</p><h3><span id=Why_Did_Naureen_Azharuddin_Remarry>Why Did Naureen Azharuddin Remarry?</span></h3><p>She was lonely after her first divorce from Mohammed Azharuddin because he had taken her son away.

As a result, she remarried ten years after her first divorce.</p><p>Naureen, Azharuddin’s wife, had a second marriage with a wealthy businessman. She also appears to have two children with him. However, she did not inform the media of his news. Her first kid, on the other hand, drew the attention of the public when he confessed wished his sibling a happy birthday.</p><p>Naureen has only one child from her marriage to Mohammad, but she now lives with her new spouse. Nonetheless, her celebrity allowed her to speak freely about Mohammed.
